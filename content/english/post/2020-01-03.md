Amongst the various kinds of deaths,

The most bitter is the death of leaves,

For at the time of their high 

It's bitter due to the disgrace of decline

Conversely, the sweetest deaths in the world,

A kind that makes the unseen visible

Upward and free of inferiority

The most pleasant is the death of flames


([Mohammad-Reza Shafiei Kadkani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad-Reza_Shafiei_Kadkani), Translation of Persian poem)
