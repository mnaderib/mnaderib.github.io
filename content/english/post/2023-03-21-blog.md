Happy Nowruz, the starting day of Spring and the Persian new year.

<div dir="rtl">
نوروز مبارک
</div>

Persians all over the world celebrate the new year at the same moment, the very moment that the Sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day and the Spring in the Northern Hemisphere begins. The exact moment for this year was today at 00:54:27 (Tehran’s local time); last year it was at 19:03:26.
Nowruz is the first day of Farvardin, the first month of the Iranian solar calendar. This calendar is the most accurate calendar in the world, thanks to Khayyam who set an starting point for its development in the 11th century.
