I would like to start writing here with a poem by [Ferdowsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi). He is one of the most influential figures of Persian literature. In Persian language, poetry is much more than the art of using aesthetic or rhythmic qualities of language. It has always been a popular approach for transfering poet's knowledge to the people. Great Persian poets have prominent contributions in Mathematics, Philosophy, and Astronomy as well.

In Ferdowsiâ€™s view, life, consciousness, and wisdom are the most honorable existing phenomena. Because of these, he considers God worthy of praise. He argues that to expect human reasoning or knowledge to understand or measure God is similar to expecting an object on a scale to weigh the person who is weighing it.

In his poems, he values and invites to learning, thinking, honesty, and goodness. According to his book "Shahnameh", it is important that at any cost, the right should prevail and the guilty should be punished. If it is other than this, the invasion of many evils will plunge the world into darkness.

In this specific poem that I'm posting here, he puts emphasis on non-stop learning.
